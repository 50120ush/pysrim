   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to pysrim's documentation!
==================================

For now I will not write comprehensive sphinx documentation. Examples
of pysrim usage can be found in the `jupyter notebooks in the example
folder of the repo
<https://gitlab.com/costrouc/srim-python/tree/master/examples/notebooks>`_. One
notebook gives an example of plots that were created for a
`publication <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cossms.2017.09.003>`_.

The primary purpose of this documentation for now is to document the
api.
